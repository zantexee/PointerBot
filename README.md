# PointerBot
The node.js modules are:
- discord.js
- mysql
- This was inspired by a guy who asked for a bot that gives a role based on points.
## Important
Didn't make the roles that the give command should be accesible for but I could, if you want to use the bot(and need the commands to be accesible only to some roles) direct message me on discord.
