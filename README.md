# PointerBot
The node.js modules are:
- discord.js
- mysql
## Important
Didn't make the roles that the give command should be accesible for but I could, if you want to use the bot(and need the commands to be accesible only to some roles), or would like me to help / modify some things direct message me on discord.
### Discord: florentin madalin#0640
#### This was made after a guy asked for something similar.
##### FORGOT TO MAKE A HELP COMMAND SO HERE ARE THE COMMANDS
- prefix + givep {number of points} {user / mention}
- prefix + checkp {user / mention(mention of individual user)} (checks the points of an individual user)
- prefix + checkmy {checks your points}
